## üèóÔ∏è QE Structure

The QE Platform enables users with developer privileges to create and manage customizable SaaS projects. Here's how the structure is organized:

- Each project on QE is referred to as an `explore`.
- The user who creates an `explore` is called the `topuser`. This user holds the highest level of access and control over the project.
- Other users can create derivatives of an `explore` based on its configuration. These derivatives are called `services`.
- The user who creates a `service` from an `explore` is known as a `middleuser`, and they are the owner of that service.
- Usage of a `service` may incur costs for the `middleuser`, which are paid to the `topuser` who owns the originating `explore`.
- QE incorporates a communication network named `nexus`, enabling all users and components (blocks) within the system to communicate seamlessly.
