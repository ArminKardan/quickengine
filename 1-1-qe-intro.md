**Critical Notes for development:**
- [Admin Panel](https://google.com) blocks are for controlling and services and workers.
- [XWebsite](https://google.com) blocks are for having end-users (customers) to deal with services and also we use them for making landing pages for our blogs, portfolios, products, etc.
- We make workers to having heaviy process done on server and having load balancing.
- We use [Device Managers](https://google.com) to control devices and hardwares like Android and use it's Sensors, features, and also control MCUs and Electronic Modules.
- [Nodejs-Worker](https://google.com) is for having every process that we need. 
- [Python-Worker](https://google.com) if there is confliction with libraries and technologies like (AI) we use python workers but it's not priority.
- [Android-Nodejs-Worker](https://google.com): If we need to have a Nodejs to be run stable on an android device.
- [Android-Python-Worker](https://google.com): If we need to have a Python to be run stable on an android device.
